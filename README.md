# EFFORTLESS MASS SPECTROSCOPY FOR ELECTROCHEMISTS

Would you like to have some trouble with your equipment and also get time for doing cool science?

The Spectro Inlets EC-MS is the first and only turnkey solution for mass spectrometry analysis of electrochemical reactions.

Ready to perform out of the box, the system is controlled by a powerful software suite allowing the control of the  potentiostat, mass spectrometer, gas, and vacuum systems from a single integrated graphical user interface.
