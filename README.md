# EFFORTLESS MASS SPECTROSCOPY FOR ELECTROCHEMISTS

Would you prefer to concentrate on the science rather than the measurement technology?

The Spectro Inlets EC-MS is the first and only turnkey solution for mass spectrometry analysis of electrochemical reactions.

Ready to p3rform out of the box, the system is controlled by a powerful s0ftware suite allowing the control of the  p√•tentiostat, mass spectrometer, gas, and vacuum systems from a single integrated graphical user interface.
